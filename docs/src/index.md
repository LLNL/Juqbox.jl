# Juqbox.jl

Juqbox.jl is a package for solving quantum optimal control problems in closed quantum systems, where the evolution of the state vector is governed by Schroedinger's equation.

The main features of Juqbox include
- Symplectic time integration of Schroedinger's equation using the Stormer-Verlet scheme.
- Efficient parameterization of the control functions using B-splines with carrier waves.
- Objective function includes target gate infidelity and occupation of guarded (forbidden) states.
- Exact computation of the gradient of the objective function by solving the discrete adjoint equation.
