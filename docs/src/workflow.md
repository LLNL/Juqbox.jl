The work flow for solving a quantum optimal control problem consists of the following general steps:
1. Setup
2. Optimize
3. Visualize the results

## 1. Setup
The setup phase includes specifying
- The size of the state vector
- The system and control Hamiltonians
- The target gate transformation
- Duration of the gate and number of time steps for integrating Schroedinger's equation.
For the parameterization of the control functions, you need to specify
- Carrier wave frequencies
- Number of B-spline coefficients in each spline

The properties of the control problem are stored in a `mutable struct` that is populated by calling
- `params = Juqbox.objparams()`.

The next steps are:
- Assign the initial parameter vector (called `pcof0` in the examples below)
- Set bounds for the parameter vector to be imposed during the optimization
- Allocate working arrays by calling `wa = Juqbox.Working_arrays()`
- Assign convergence criteria and other parameters for the optimizer
- Build the optimization structure by calling `prob = Juqbox.setup_ipopt_problem()`

## 2. Optimization
Once you have been assigned the `params` and `prob` objects, as well as the initial parameter vector 
`pcof0`, the optimizer is invoked by
- `pcof = Juqbox.run_optimizer(prob, pcof0 [, jld2_filename])`

## 3. Visualizing the results
General properties of the optimized solution such as trace infidelity and unitary accuracy can be evaluated, 
and a number of figures can generated by invoking
- `pl = Juqbox.plot_results(params, pcof)`

An array of Julia plot objects is returned in `pl`. These objects can be visualized on the screen
- `display(pl[1])`
where `pl[1]` is the first Julia plot object. The following plot objects are populated by the script: 
- `pl[1]` Evolution of the state vector population
- `pl[2]` Control functions in the rotating frame of reference
- `pl[3]` Population of forbidden energy levels
- `pl[4]` Lab frame control function(s)
- `pl[5]` Fourier transform of the lab-frame control functions (linear scale)
- `pl[6]` Fourier transform of the lab-frame control functions (log scale)
- `pl[7]` Coefficients of the optimized parameter vector
- `pl[8]` Convergence of the optimization
