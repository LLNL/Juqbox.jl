The file x-risk-neutral.jl is a template file that is called by run_all.jl.
To run the full deterministic and risk-neutral optimization simply
type

include("run_all.jl")

in the Julia REPL. To modify the control term that is 
scaled by error, the eval_f_par and eval_grad_f_par 
routines within src/ipopt_interface.jl should be updated to 
the desired noise model. An update of the ep_plot routine in 
run_all.jl should also match that of the updates to ipopt_interface.jl
for the purposes of plotting changes in the objective functions for 
both deterministic and risk-neutral optimal controls with respect
to the uncertainty.
